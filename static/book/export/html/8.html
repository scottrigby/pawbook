I can actually see the green light coming out even if the Skype’s muted. And it’s generally, like right now … Okay. Great. Like how long should it be? I’m kind of holding about six inches from my mouth. I’m talking right now. Okay. Well right now it’s …<br /><br />Male 2: I think this is interesting aspect of demonstrations who in most [0:43:22] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Male 1: Okay, cool. Thanks a lot [0:43:25] [Inaudible] I appreciate it.<br /><br />Male 2: There’s a certain [0:43:34] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Male 1: Awesome. Thanks a lot then, buh-bye.<br /><br />[Background Talk]<br /><br />Male 3: Although I’m not sure that’s unique or specific to the [0:46:53] [Inaudible] I wish I could say that [0:46:56] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Male 2: It must [0:46:58] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Male 3: Right. I sent these to the [0:47:26] [Inaudible] questions.<br /><br />Male 2: Actually most of the call from the [0:47:52] [Inaudible] the participants [0:48:01] [Inaudible] most participants were [0:48:06] [Inaudible]. Like there was one guy who took the chance to [0:48:26] [Inaudible]<br /><br />[1:09:43] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Male 1: By the way Conrad, our audio is  … It’s possible that we might be able to connect with audio but we haven’t tried because for the [1:15:56] [Inaudible] it’s been disconnected. The three people that normally help us connect the component to this, all have emergencies that came up which is okay. We have actually been able to have a pretty decent one way of discussion. Anyway, we’ve been able to contribute by text.<br /><br />Male 4: So you’re texting and they’re answering?<br /><br />Male 1: Pretty much. Well, there are audience coming in and there’s about – I’m not sure how many people are on the call right now because people drop in and off. Okay. So ten people are on the call or ten location are on the call right now. But I’m just giving a heads up. [1:16:30] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Male 4: That’s been going on for a little while.<br /><br />Male 1: Oh, yeah. We started at six. I should probably open this for everyone.<br /><br />Male 2: Is there [1:16:50] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Male 1: Yeah, yeah. We’re recording this. IN fact, luckily I’m able to record them because we’re not able to contribute to the audio. IN fact we could. One thing is I have all the equipment, some quality headphones and I kind of don’t like turn it on and blast everybody out. I want to make sure everybody is okay.<br /><br />Male 4: So [1:17:15] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Male 1: This would be where the headphone comes in. These could go to other devices, other input devices. Actually, that’s an output device, another speaker. Okay.<br /><br />Male 3: [1:17:33] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Male 1: Yeah.<br /><br />Male 4: So they were working [1:17:39] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Male 1: Like us, yeah. We tried to – oops, I guess that’s not helpful. Oh yeah.<br /><br />Male 3: [1:17:50] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Male 1: [Laughter]. Is that what it should be [1:17:57] [Inaudible] to? You know, we – Jeremy right? Jeremy’s least favorite place in New York.<br /><br />Male 3: They call the art types of people come out of there …<br /><br />Male 1: Yeah.<br /><br />Male 4: Is Greg on or is he?<br /><br />Male 1: Greg is on. Greg is actually under this name right now. And right now we’re under my personal Skype account because we couldn’t both be on audio same time out of the same account because you can’t end yourself [1:18:33] [Inaudible] actually on.<br /><br />Male 2: [1:18:43] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Male 1: Do you mind if I [1:19:04] [Inaudible]?<br /><br />Male 5: No. Go ahead.<br /><br />[1:19:09] [Inaudible]<br /><br />[Background Noise]<br /><br />Male 3: Not sure a few spots even.<br /><br />Male 2: I just [1:20:07] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Male 3: Me too.<br /><br />Male 2: You also?<br /><br />Male 3: [1:20:16] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Male 2: Yeah.<br /><br />Male 3: [1:20:22] [Inaudible] Artworld? I mean the Artworld didn’t [1:20:59] [Inaudible]  Do you think that we’re – do you see yourself participating in [1:21:24] [Inaudible] a different Artworld or do you see this kind of [1:21:31] [Inaudible] plausible other Artworld [1:21:35] [Inaudible].<br /><br />Male 2: I think [1:21:54] [Inaudible] [Background Noise] So it’ important to use [1:22:52] [Inaudible].<br /><br />Male 3: [1:23:24] [Inaudible].<br /><br />Male 2: [1:23:44] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Male 3: [1:24:04] [Inaudible] let’s not give  up on art. Let’s not give up on the Artworld. Plausible Artworld [1:25:18] [Inaudible] It looks like simple art. Why [1:25:27] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Male 2: You mean the spectators?<br /><br />[Background Noise]<br /><br />Male 3: Or are engaging in art [1:25:45] [Inaudible] . Your sharing a lot of those things you decide to [1:26:05] [Inaudible] and you want to stay in the [Background Noise] People are challenged [1:26:11] [Inaudible]. You actually continue to [1:26:16] [Inaudible] in art [1:26:17] [Inaudible]. This is not the [Background Noise]. [1:26:47] [expand and to cooperate to] [1:26:50] [Inaudible]Also get involved with the non Artworld. [1:27:01] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Male 2: The best that you mentioned [1:27:25] [Inaudible]. maybe that’s a good [1:27:29] [Inaudible].<br /><br />Male 5: [1:28:09] [Inaudible] I was wondering about [1:28:22] [Inaudible] when you talk about artistic competence, what are you actually talking about?<br /><br />Male 2: I think it’s a [1:28:36] [Inaudible] competence.<br /><br />Male 5: What does that mean? I mean I [1:28:42] [Inaudible] too but I we would like to know what you think of it when you say that.<br /><br />Male 2: Well, I mean [1:28:54] [Inaudible] We design the [1:29:15] [Inaudible]. We look for strategies and we [1:29:25] [Inaudible]. We do it on our specific [1:29:40] [background].<br /><br />Male 5: [1:29:43] [Inaudible]how we [1:29:51] [Inaudible]<br /><br />[Whispering]<br /><br />Male 2: No, I don’t really [1:30:12] [Inaudible] because we don’t really [1:30:16] [Inaudible]. We really try to [1:30:29] [Inaudible] by [1:30:33] [Inaudible]. And I think we are interested in this specific [1:30:44] [Inaudible] that is [1:30:47] [Inaudible]that focus so much on the work as a product.<br /><br />Male 1: By the way, I think [1:31:16] [Inaudible] have any other – any thoughts or questions about any other, just tell me. Feel free to try to type them up.  Greg has also offered to use, to put our phone on speakerphone on his side near our mike. So, we could even also try this –actually maybe this is a good time. [Typing].<br /><br />Male 2: I don’t know if you call it Michael’s comment / question about he talks about the plausible article [1:32:19] [Inaudible] network created activity operating outside the [1:32:23] [Inaudible]. I’m not sure if [1:32:26] [Inaudible] on the matter. [1:32:31] [Inaudible].<br /><br />Male 3: I think that [1:32:37] [Inaudible].<br /><br />Male 5: [1:32:40] [Inaudible] [Background Noise]<br /><br />[Audio Gap]<br /><br />Male 5: [1:33:22] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Male 3: Just [1:33:22] [Inaudible] for Scott is that he just might, may or may not work. I think – oh, there we go.<br /><br />Male 2: [1:34:22] [Inaudible]<br />Male 5: [1:34:26] [Inaudible]<br /><br />[Laughter]<br /><br />Male 1: See if this works. Guys, can you hear us up? Hello? Oh, let’s try this one more time. Can you hear us at all? Is this any better? Anything?<br /><br />Male 6: Anything? Hello? Hello?<br /><br />Male 3: Yeah. [1:35:04] [Inaudible]. Okay.<br /><br />Male 1: Well. I don’t know if [1:35:19] [Inaudible] a natural closure [1:35:21] [Inaudible] people out there have more questions and yeah, really [1:35:26] [Inaudible]. I know I’ve enjoyed it and I think everybody else there as well. But if there are not anymore questions or any further questions, I just want to thank you [1:35:43] [Inaudible] very much for joining us. Here we go. Michael curious about, yeah, I’m like their collaborating, maybe just a little bit of background.<br /><br />Male 2: [1:36:02] [Inaudible]. We came together when we were students in 1995. And then we come in 1996 [1:36:17] [Inaudible]. because we are students and we are [1:36:23] [Inaudible]. And so we act like our true  responses and [1:36:39] [Inaudible]. And so also we invited guests . have lectures and are performances of artists. That was quite an [1:36:53] [Inaudible] place for two years. But then we continue – we came to our concept of we are more oriented on the international scale. But I test one thing [1:37:16] [Inaudible] and one thing on my mind, just to follow the  [1:37:23] [Inaudible] of the what is it like to specific, the quality of this kind of activity. I think we have [1:37:41] [Inaudible] that we are [1:37:43] [Inaudible] right now of our project, our product.  It can be our product, but I think [1:37:49] [Inaudible] and at [1:37:54] [Inaudible]. And if maybe we go all the different participants are collaborating with us, that’s at least like this is a specific [1:38:10] [Inaudible]. And to go back to when we came together, this was also [1:38:34] [Inaudible]. We were at the same arts academy in [1:38:41] [Inaudible]. When we make our exam, we [1:38:50] [Inaudible] who make together as a student. So we have to know professor and our project was we [1:39:02] [Inaudible]. Combining our talent, combining items, combining [1:39:11] [Inaudible]. And just like we have two sets of this game and as long as 1:39:19.4 we make workshop with business people. And [1:39:27] [Inaudible]with unemployed people. And we want to figure out about their creativity and imagination of combination [Background Noise]. We presented once in the chap member. This was the [1:39:51] [Inaudible] of the business people. And the unemployed people, we presented in their empowerment of [1:40:00] [Inaudible]. And [1:40:02] [Inaudible]. we did a conference.<br /><br />Male 2: What is in [1:40:39] [Inaudible].<br /><br /><br />Male 6: Mr. 1:40:40.7 on Skype texting one another, messaging one another but neither able to communicate verbally.
