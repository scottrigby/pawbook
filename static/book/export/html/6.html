We see you on the wall now.<br /><br />Male 2:  [0:00:59] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Scott: Larger than life. I’m waving back but you can’t see me.<br /><br />[Laughter]<br /><br />Male 2: Hey, Scott.<br /><br />Scott: Hey.<br /><br />Male 2: [0:01:25] [Inaudible] some pictures. I didn’t get enough chance to [0:01:29] [Inaudible] and share to people.[0:01:34] [Inaudible] going to talk about. But maybe you could [0:01:38] [Inaudible] and start talking about [0:01:40] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Scott: Sure. I guess what we could is we could upload the images to photo which –<br /><br />Male 2: [0:01:49] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Female 1: Yeah. Just to get pumping. We’ll just do what you were about to do.<br /><br />Scott: [Laughter] Rock on. If you want me to do it, I can, you know if you want to focus on the talk but it’s up to you.<br /><br />Male 2: Oh, okay.<br /><br />Female 1: [0:02:06] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Male 2: Yeah. I’m going to send them. Which should I send them to?<br /><br />Scott: Oh, emailing? You can send it to projects@basekamp.com. That way several of us will get it.<br /><br />Male 2: [0:02:26] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Scott: If you send it thru Skype I think it’ll send to everybody in the Skype chat there, unless you have any separate one.<br /><br />Male 2: I’ll set up a separate one here [0:02:40] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Female 1:  Let’s start he talk.<br /><br />Male 2:  [0:02:53] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Scott: I was actually just suggesting that we wait just another moment because there are very many people here. Why don’t we wait. I was gonna say till quarter after but that’s in three minutes. That’s probably okay. Why don’t wait at least until then. And then go ahead and get started and people can join in when they do.<br /><br />Male 2: Alright. [Cross-talk] [0:03:16] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Scott: Yes. Definitely.<br /><br />Male 2: Right?<br /><br />Scott: I’m not sure.<br /><br />[Background Noise]<br /><br />Male 2: Wait a minute [0:03:45] [Inaudible].<br /><br />Scott: Yeah. Michael is coming. He’s running a few minutes late.<br /><br />Female 1: What’d you do?<br /><br />Male 2: [0:04:02] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Scott: Yeah I think that’s sent to everybody. [Cross-talk]<br /><br />[Laughter]<br /><br />Female 1: Aah.<br /><br />Scott: No worries, it’s all good.<br /><br />Female 2: Doing great. [0:04:27] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Unidentified Male: Oh, you guys haven’t seen the library yet.<br /><br />Male 2: No, we haven’t. [0:04:57] [Inaudible]  [Cross-talk]<br /><br />Scott: I’ll grab a couple and put them on flicker and send you guys a little of it.<br /><br />Male 2: [0:05:16] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Scott: That was my way of saying I think that’s a good idea. Cool. So, now it’s nearly 6:15. We should probably check in. Matt, who is on this, why don’t I ask people who would like to join the audio and we’ll start adding people now.<br /><br />I probably should have done that ahead of time. I think we got caught up on the recording side because we didn’t want to be a tree falling in the woods. Although we could if we had to. But now that we don’t have to, that’s probably a good thing.<br /><br />[Background Noise]<br /><br />I need to add. Where is Adam and Jessica? Okay, anyway, Matt, we can add to the chat. Oh, yeah. [0:06:55] [Inaudible]. Awesome. [Background Talk].<br /><br />[Background Noise]<br /><br />Okay. There’s someone here who is really trying to join but we cannot seem to add them easily.<br /><br />Unidentified Male: Seventh?<br /><br />Scott: Yes.<br /><br />Male 2: [0:08:22] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Scott: Yeah. That happens sometimes. Like last week, we had to ask some of them to restart. Adding Abby now? So, Matt, can you hear us, by the way?<br /><br />Male 3: [0:08:36] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Scott: Okay, great.  I think we’re going to go ahead and get started soon. We’re jus – preferably week by week we’ll inch minutes closer to starting at six.<br /><br />Male 2: Alright.<br /><br />Scott: So … Did anyone else on the track ask to be added to the audio that I [0:08:59] [Inaudible]. Okay? Okay, cool. So what do you think, Greg? Do you want to – oh you’re adding us to [0:09:13] [Inaudible].<br /><br />Greg: Well, I mean I could stop to it.<br /><br />Scott: Okay. [0:09:21] [Inaudible] it’d be pretty cool.<br /><br />Greg: Well, I can do that. It’s up to you. I mean …<br /><br />Scott: Mabel’s copy. Oh, thank you, Steven.<br /><br />Male 2: [0:09:33] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Scott: Where’s Mabel? I don’t see Mabel, Steven.<br /><br />Male 2:  [0:09:42] [Inaudible]<br /><br />[Background Talk]<br /><br />Scott: Great. So if you can give us just one more moment. I think – oh, fantastic.<br /><br />Male 2: [0:10:46] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Scott: If you don’t mind, can I just try to get Adam and Jessica on the call real quick? I believe they have a class that’s supposed to patch in here. And I would sort of hate to miss them. Although I don’t want to put you off any longer so …<br /><br />Male 2: [0:11:12] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Scott: Right now, audio? 1-2-3-4-5-6.<br /><br />Greg: She’s, Jessica doesn’t seem to be able to get to …<br /><br />Male 2: [0:11:36] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Scott: No, absolutely not.<br /><br />Greg: Our U stream is buffering.<br /><br />Scott: But that’s okay because if we need to we can always refresh it.<br /><br />Greg: Okay, you got it.<br /><br />Scott: Okay, cool.  Now writing Adam. Fantastic.<br /><br />[Background Noise]<br /><br />Male 2: [0:12:54] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Scott: Hi, Adam, can you hear us by the way?<br /><br />Adam: [0:13:07] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Scott: Hey, fantastic, yeah. So did you guys have your class hooked up to this tonight?<br /><br />Adam: Yes. [0:13:17] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Scott: Awesome.<br /><br />Male 4: Hi, everybody.<br /><br />[Laughter]<br /><br />Scott: So if you guys could turn your microphone up a little bit, Adam, we could actually hear you. I think it’s just a little bit low.<br /><br />Adam: [0:13:51] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Scott: Oh, that’s not possible?<br /><br />Adam: Yeah. [0:13:55] [Inaudible]  <br /><br />Scott:  Oh, that’s totally fine.<br /><br />Greg:  Whatever you’re doing now is better.<br /><br />Adam: I’m talking louder.<br /><br />Scott:  You’re yelling.<br /><br />[Laughter]<br /><br />Excellent. Okay, why don’t we go ahead and start chatting so that we’re not just waiting. So yeah –<br /><br />Adam: Is there a [0:14:29] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Scott: There is a text chatter. You guys not in the text chatter? I thought you were. Oh, I guess you’re not. Hold on a second. Here you go. Great. So how about this now? Can I sort of replace this Greg?<br /><br />Greg: Yeah. [0:14:50] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Scott: [0:14:50] [Inaudible]. Well, first of all, welcome everyone. Thanks for coming to our little weekly chat. [Laughter]. Can you all hear me? Okay.<br /><br />Male 2: Scott, which one [0:15:10] [Inaudible]. Did you invite us?<br /><br />Scott: Yeah, I believe so.<br /><br />Adam: [0:15:14] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Scott: Oh, I see.<br /><br />Adam: [0:15:18] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Scott: Yeah. If you click into there first. I think you have to click in first, you kind of can’t [0:15:25] [Inaudible]. Stay there. Now you can [0:15:28] [Inaudible].<br /><br />Greg: Alright. So I’ve got Jessica in. oh, she got banned?<br /><br />Scott: Yeah. For some reason it’s saying that we cannot add you to the text chat. I don’t really know why that would be. It says …<br /><br />Greg: Jessica [0:15:45] [Inaudible] is using an older version of Skype that does not support  multi person chat?<br /><br />Male 2: [0:15:50] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Scott: Yeah, we did that first but let’s try that again. We’ll try one more time and if not, the … Oh, look at that.<br /><br />Greg: Here you go. Oh.<br /><br />Scott: Oh, you got bounced.<br /><br />Greg: Same thing.<br /><br />Scott: You got bounced. Sorry, guys, that’s actually really annoying, isn’t it?<br /><br />Male 2: Okay. I that a [0:16:10] [Inaudible]  <br /><br />Greg: Yes.<br /><br />Male 2: Thank you.<br /><br />Scott: Rock n Roll. So great. Welcome everybody to our little chat. We’ll be adding more people throughout the evening, more people’s audio. So if anyone sees someone on Skype that [0:16:38] [Inaudible] that’s pleading to be added, please let us know. We just might not be noticing it, okay? Great. So first of all, I want to welcome Brett and Bonnie, our invited guests for the week.<br /><br />Brett: Hi Scott. Hi Greg and Steven.<br /><br />Bonnie: Hi.<br /><br />Scott: Hi.<br /><br />Greg: Hi.<br /><br />Scott: And hi everybody –<br /><br />Greg: Natalie, hang on a second. Sorry.<br /><br />Scott: Cool. The way the evening will go is – just to let everyone know, this week, Bret and Bonnie will be giving a more straightforward presentation probably for about 20 to 30 minutes or so and after which we can have a Q&amp;A and a less structured discussion.<br /><br />So first of all, everyone at the class, once we actually get to that point it would be great if you guys could flag us whenever you can on text or kind of like step up to the  computer’s microphone so that we can hear you.<br /><br />In any case, and then we can just spend the rest of the evening on that. And near the end, what we’re going to be doing with this week and future weeks throughout the year is focus a bit of time at the end, kind of reviewing some of the ideas and interests that came up through the evening.<br /><br />And see if we can come up with some course proposals for the public school. At the end we’re going to be generating public school courses at the end of every week or at the end of every Tuesday night, I mean. So Brett and Bonnie, just let you guys know, we’ve been in dialogue for probably about ten years now.<br /><br />And one thing I should probably say now that I just remembered; if everyone can press mute on your Skype until you want to say something, that will be excellent.<br /><br />It will help keep the feedback really low. But, at any case, we’d known each other for years now and one of the reasons specifically though that we invited Brett and Bonnie to come in talk with us tonight is because they’re working on this called The Library of Radiant Optimism for Let’s Re-make the World which is a long-term project that they’ve started. I won’t describe it in detail.<br /><br />I’ll leave that to them. But as sure, we’re looking at this project as what we’re calling a plausible artworld because they’re focusing on some highly optimistic work and DIY manuals from the ‘60s and ‘70s and the range of practices that grew out of that era. They also do work together.<br /><br />In many ways is inspired by that era and the work that they are compiling in their library and they seek to work together with other people who are similarly I think reinvigorating some of those practices from that time. And so we’d like to focus on that side of what they’re doing, those networks that were created and are continuing to be created now. Anyway, Brett and Bonnie, would you guys mind going ahead and giving us an intro to The Library of Radiant Optimism?<br /><br />Brett: Sure, Scott. [0:20:29] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Scott: Awesome.<br /><br />Brett: [0:20:36] [Inaudible]  Bonnie and I discovered [0:20:52] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Scott: Okay. We’ll let them know thru the text chat. You guys can go ahead and keep on going.<br /><br />Brett: Okay. That sounds good. So Bonnie [0:23:49] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Bonnie: So the first. I’m Bonnie. [0:24:22] [Inaudible] the first few books that were [0:24:25] [Inaudible] project came from our personal collection. And [0:24:31] [Inaudible]. And it’s [0:24:35] [Inaudible] because the book document not only, it [0:24:56] [Inaudible]. So pretty great book and Brett can tell you about [0:25:40] [Inaudible] now.<br /><br />Brett: Alright.  [0:25:42] [Inaudible]  published probably and it’s been around for less than a thousand hard bound black and white [0:26:14] [Inaudible]  produced [0:26:15] [Inaudible]  from internet and useful source. Yeah. [0:26:28] [Inaudible]  it’s really interesting [0:26:34] [Inaudible] experiment [0:26:35] [Inaudible] your [0:26:36] [Inaudible] as well as create small efficient psychological values [0:26:44] [Inaudible] rethinking [0:26:47] [Inaudible] . [Cross-talk].<br /><br />Bonnie: This is where we are guys. We found this book in a [0:28:00] [Inaudible] near it in [0:28:02] [Inaudible]. And this is a radical [0:28:05] [Inaudible] community of the [0:28:10] [Inaudible] community now.  <br /><br />Brett: Primary [0:28:13] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Bonnie:  The primary community now and made by people in our town in the [0:28:18] [Inaudible]  all of the academic art [0:28:25] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Brett: Yeah. [0:28:35] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Scott: No.<br /><br />Brett: [0:28:48] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Scott: Sorry, sorry. Hey guys.<br /><br />[Background Talk]<br /><br />Brett: So, another part of what we have [0:28:59] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Bonnie: Oh, oh yeah. [0:29:19] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Brett: [0:29:56] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Bonnie: [0:30:18] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Scott: Guys, sorry about the continual audio [0:30:38] [Inaudible]. We’re just adding people up [Cross-talk] Okay. Super.<br /><br />[Cross-talk]<br /><br />Bonnie: [0:30:48] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Brett: [0:31:15] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Bonnie: [0:32:30] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Brett: [0:33:14] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Bonnie: [0:34:00] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Brett: [0:34:55] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Bonnie: [0:36:36] [Inaudible] Is there anything we can do to change that? So [0:37:51] [Inaudible] they’ve been making illustrations imagining what  people would look like by [0:38:34] [Inaudible]. We produced a different kinds of poster that you would see right here on this table and [0:39:08] [Inaudible] on the wall here. We’ll put a [0:39:13] [Inaudible]. This is one thing [0:39:18] [Inaudible] library. [0:39:21] [Inaudible]. We definitely [0:39:36] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Brett: [ 0:41:35] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Scott: I was just going to say Brett. No, never mind.<br /><br />Brett: Yeah?<br /><br />Scott: I’m sorry dude. Just not to trample over you, but yeah, we have a stack here, like basically a box of books that Bonnie and Brett shipped here that we’re giving away to people that come.<br /><br />So if you’re local and Philly and you are just listening on Skype, just flag us down, let us know the [0:43:06] [Inaudible] for you if you‘ve joined tonight and get to wing by some other time to pick it up. I’ll post photos of the library right now. Philip, Philip. Greg was just saying he’ll post photos of the library on flicker right now and we’ll send you the leg.<br /><br />Brett: [0:43:24] [Inaudible] website later as well.<br /><br />Bonnie: So, tonight [0:44:04] [Inaudible] Library of Radiant Optimism for Let’s Remake the World book of the launched book. And this is [0:44:33] [Inaudible] project . We’re [0:44:36] [Inaudible] uploaded a new title and [0:44:43] [Inaudible]. Our website and [0:44:48] [Inaudible]. [Laughter] but [0:44:56] [Inaudible] . The first title in [0:45:02] [Inaudible] child. [0:45:05] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Scott: Hey, Bonnie.  Sorry. Can I interrupt you for a quick sec? Hey, Bonnie? Hey, did you guys – is the video down? Because it looks like other people are not getting the video. We thought it was just us.<br /><br />Brett: [0:45:23] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Scott: It’s okay. We’re just checking.<br /><br />Bonnie: [0:45:27] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Scott: Okay. Cool., cool Carry on. If –<br /><br />Brett: [0:45:30] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Scott:  Just in case you didn’t know. Thanks. But yeah, please go on about the book of the month club.<br /><br />Bonnie: [0:45:37] [Inaudible]  The video will be back in just a second.<br /><br />Scott: Awesome.<br /><br />Bonnie: In the meantime, [0:45:47] [Inaudible]  Brett?<br /><br />Brett: I dunno. No. [0:45:51] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Scott: Oh, really.<br /><br />Brett: [0:45:56] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Scott: That’s completely fine.<br /><br />Brett: [0:46:11] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Bonnie: [0:46:14] [Inaudible]  and in the meantime we’ll go [0:46:17] [Inaudible]  the posters here.<br /><br />Scott: Thank you.<br /><br />Bonnie: [0:46:20] [Inaudible]  And we are – we think that [0:46:26] [Inaudible]   we haven’t shared them with others and this is our [0:46:43] [Inaudible]  of the library project and one of  the reasons that we [0:46:48] [Inaudible]  was that basekamp provided us with the [0:46:53] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Brett: [0:49:31] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Bonnie: [0:51:02] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Brett: And we found many people [0:51:31] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Scott: Great. Guys, thank you so much for that key end to your project. I think  if we went ahead and had a quick conversation without that presentation,  many of the people here wouldn’t have any idea what kinds of things you’re talking about or what range of practices you’re looking at. Yeah.<br /><br />By the way, anybody that wants to, anyone on the call can feel free to unmute at any time to ask a question. Or I’ll say you can send to your text chat as well. It might be worth [0:53:02] [Inaudible].<br /><br />Brett: Hey, Greg.<br /><br />Greg: Yeah<br /><br />Brett: [0:53:09] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Male  1: Oh, sorry can you –<br /><br />Brett : [0:53:17] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Scott: Sorry guys. When people ask you a question --  I was sort of was guilty about this. This is Scott speaking right now. Can you just briefly introduce yourself, just sort of saying who is speaking so we can all know. One of the requests we had from last week was that people had no idea who was talking. This is Adam, right? Is this  Ad –<br /><br />Unidentified Male:<br /><br />Scott: Oh, okay. I didn’t hear.<br /><br />Unidentified male: [0:53:44] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Brett: Okay. [0:54:23] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Scott: So, guys, the mike’s on right now. So if you wanna say anything, ask anything, just flag me and I’ll unmute it. And then I can help flag it down too.<br /><br />Bonnie: [0:56:21] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Scott: Hello, yeah. No, we’re here. We just have ourselves  muted  so you don’t hear the interment and kung fu while you’re talking. And we’ll unmute as people have questions or wanna say something. Did you have something that you wanted to say? You can. But I think you need to get a little closer.<br /><br />Unidentified Male: I mean, these books, you’re just selecting them  previous – I mean, you’re selecting as the book of the month from previous  publications, right in the 60s and 70s. They are not books that you are actually bringing up, right, like publishing and writing.<br /><br />Brett: [0:57:04] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Bonnie: Yeah. [0:57:46] [Inaudible].  We will be uploading a new file this month. We actually [0:57:50] [Inaudible]  the books that are in our library or the books [0:57:55] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Brett: Yeah. And we are also publishing our own books but that’s not part of [0:58:20] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Bonnie: [0:58:52] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Brett: [0:59:19] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Bonnie: [1:00:35] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Brett: [1:01:34] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Bonnie: Do we have some more questions [1:03:04] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Scott:  Yeah. Steven had a question. We can read it out loud if that would be helpful or Steven can actually read it out loud if you’d like to ask or you –<br /><br />Bonnie: Sure.<br /><br />Scott: I was just thinking that it might be good to repeat it for everyone, one way or the other. Steven, are you there? Would you like to or would you rather one of us do it?<br /><br />Steven: [1:03:28] [Inaudible]<br /><br />[Laughter]<br /><br />[Cross-talk]<br /><br />Scott: Brett, I hope your mom and dad are in town are listening to this.<br /><br />Brett: [1:04:40] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Steven: [1:04:53] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Brett: [1:05:02] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Bonnie: [1:08:55] [Inaudible]  <br /><br />Scott: Yeah, just unmute it.<br /><br />Michael: Hi there. This is Michael at [1:09:00] [Inaudible]. I’m interested in what you guys mentioned about sort of idea of cultural amnesia or ways and which  I guess there can be extended projects or ways to activate some of this material that you’re sharing. I guess the second part of the question would be, has there been any interest in terms of connecting with the intentional community that you guys mentioned in Tennessee that’s still up and running. I hope that makes sense.<br /><br />Brett: Yeah. [1:09:42] [Inaudible] in Tennessee?<br /><br />Michael: Yeah.<br /><br />Bonnie: I mean [1:09:47] [Inaudible]<br /><br />[Cross-talk]<br /><br />Brett: [1:10:01] [[Inaudible]<br /><br />Bonnie:  [1:12:19] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Brett: [1:13:44] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Bonnie:  So another question?<br /><br />Scott: Yeah. Hi. I think Greg had the next question. Do you still remember?<br /><br />Greg: I have no idea but I’ll make one up.  No. I remember. IN fact it’s about remembering in a particular way right? I’m curious how these books carry a certain sense of nostalgia and how that might affect sort of the potential for the book to be acted upon because it seems like you guys are really about the intentionality, the thoughtfulness, the content really, less so in the context of kind of culture.<br /><br />But still along that some of the questions that Steven was raising. Is nostalgia a dangerous emotion or how does that factor in to you as you read it and how potentially the view in public might interpret these texts? As like, ha-ha, goofy or wow, this is incredible stuff, you know.<br /><br />Brett: [1:15:21] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Bonnie: [1:18:47] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Brett: [1:19:31] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Bonnie: We’re trying to include more issues of [1:20:27] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Brett: yeah. We’re also doing [1:20:43] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Scott: Thank you. That was great. That absolutely covered it more. Thanks. So Hank had a quick question actually. And then Steven did. Hank was asking who your audience is or  if you have a target audience or if you market your projects at all? She was curious I guess about who you’re speaking to? Oh, sorry if you wanted to say [1:21:31] [Inaudible]  okay.  Hey, Gerick. Hey. Come on guys. Come on in and have a seat, guys. Brett and Bonnie and everybody, we just have some more people coming in and –<br /><br />Female 1:  Hi people. [1:21:44] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Scott: Hannah, did you have anything else to ask about that or did I –<br /><br />Female 1: Well, I mean, I guess, you know, I work in the design field and I guess, you know, I just been recently really interested in kind of how projects relate like if there’s a specific target for this information getting distributed and who, you know, if that’s thought about in the process.<br /><br />And in turn, you know, we can all sit and discuss this information. I guess it’s just interesting to me that process of if there’s a goal in mind as far as distributing these information or if it’s just open discussion with likeminded people. I guess that’s kind of – yeah, the basis of my question.<br /><br />Brett: [1:22:42] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Bonnie: [1:22:47] [Inaudible]  control center. So that meant that there were  [1:23:08] [Inaudible].  There were discussions sort of like a community center. Okay. So within that space there was cultural [1:23:23] [Inaudible]  Brett and I both noticed almost at the same time that [1:23:35] [Inaudible]  and that really sort of [1:23:48][Inaudible]<br /><br />Brett:  And there also  seems an explosion and interest in these terms of [1:23:58] [Inaudible] issues and [1:24:00] [Inaudible]  but I think there is a research and  interest on this kind of information and it often goes, like we’re saying the history of these things. [1:24:25] [Inaudible] so the history [1:24:29] [Inaudible] working on the internet which are called [1:25:03] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Bonnie: [1:25:11] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Brett: So, its –oh thanks.<br /><br />Scott: Yeah. He’s not on the call yet but he will be in a second.<br /><br />Brett: Okay, guys. So [1:25:22] [Inaudible]. That’s quite [1:25:30] [Inaudible] in art to figure out sometimes. We’re also. We also [1:25:36] [Inaudible] who lived in Cummings. [1:25:38] [Inaudible].<br /><br />[Cross-talk]<br /><br />Female 1: [1:26:02] [Inaudible] Aaron’s question and then I’m going to put Steven Wright’s question which I think is great  about other international histories that [1:26:17] [Inaudible] and so we’ll take Aaron’s now? Is that okay with everybody? And that question is, what do we mean by  [1:26:30] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Brett: Okay. So  Aaron is, in terms of plausible artworlds, we’ll just say that [1:26:35] [Inaudible].  We jokingly call ourselves librarians but we’re not trained as librarians. [1:26:55] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Bonnie: Yeah. Exactly. The first reason [1:27:38] [Inaudible] of our practice. We only [1:27:42] [Inaudible] and we use  [1:27:44] [Inaudible] that’s because that’s the world that we’re involved in. But yeah, there are  many [1:28:01] [Inaudible]. It’s not a library  [1:28:11] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Brett: Yeah. But it is a [1:28:21] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Bonnie: But it’s a [1:28:21] [Inaudible] at the same time so [Cross-talk]. And we actually had a [1:28:31] [Inaudible]<br /><br />[Cross-talk]<br /><br />Brett: We’re going now to Steven’s question.<br /><br />Bonnie: Steven asked,  he’s kind of wondering why we focused on the United States and he’s talking about [1:29:03] [Inaudible] in France and [1:29:05] [Inaudible]  in this country as a  separate secularly [1:29:08] [Inaudible]. But not only that. And here is the [1:29:15] [Inaudible] Argentina, Turkey [1:29:20] [Inaudible] and I think that’s a really big question. And we have been talking about adding books [Cross-talk].<br /><br />Brett: [1:29:33] [Inaudible]  from Denmark that we want to add. I ‘m sure the books [1:29:39] [Inaudible] in Canada and in the United states.  [1:30:10] [Inaudible].<br /><br />Bonnie: Yeah. I think [1:31:23] [Inaudible]  from power points to sound to other things. These are things that we are [1:31:45] [Inaudible]  at to the library [1:31:48] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Brett: Alright. So let me add a question for Aaron.<br /><br />Bonnie: Okay. So this is another question about plausible artworlds. [1:32:04] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Brett: [1:32:06] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Bonnie: Aaron is asking, you mentioned that you use that in your project in your daily lives and then added that in art context as well. And since you did [1:32:17] [Inaudible] I wonder in that case what other context you define as art?<br /><br />Brett: Okay. So I think those contexts [1:32:25] [Inaudible] already by other people. So [1:32:31] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Bonnie: We have [1:34:44] [Inaudible]  <br /><br />Brett: Okay. I’m just typing in [1:35:27] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Scott: I was curious if Adam, if any of your students have questions. I wanna hear from them. If Adam’s still with us, I’m not sure.<br /><br />Unidentified Male: [1:35:50] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Brett: I’m sorry? [1:36:04] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Unidentified Male: [1:36:07] [Inaudible]<br /><br />[Cross-talk]<br /><br />Scott: Okay. Guys, I just wanted to mention something really quickly. Actually Bonnie, can you hear us okay?<br /><br />Bonnie: Yeah. [1:36:30] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Scott: Okay good. I just saw that you were breaking up but they seemed like it wasn’t like a very contemporary way of breaking up with us., but your just saying the audio you can hear. You’ve heard about all that, right? So I guess we won’t get into that.<br /><br />Bonnie: [1:36:47] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Scott: Yeah. That would be a text message. But yeah, if everybody would be into it, or if anybody would be into this, we could still continue to discuss this but as it’s now quarter till the time when we usually stop out chat,  one of the things I wanted to  --<br /><br />Brett: Scott, [1:37:10] [Inaudible] one more question [1:37:11] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Scott: Oh, I’m sorry. I thought you said that you didn’t. I apologized. Yeah. Totally.<br /><br />Unidentified Male: [1:37:17] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Scott: Oh, yeah. Rocking.<br /><br />Unidentified Male: Alright, Scott. Did you ever build any of these things [1:37:27] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Brett: Yeah. There was a lot of things that were kind of related [1:37:41] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Bonnie: I think I checked this out [1:37:46] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Brett: Yeah. [1:37:49] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Scott: Oh, yeah. We can see you guys now actually holding up a lamp. There might be a delay.<br /><br />[Laughter]<br /><br />Greg: Ask Brett to move back towards the [1:40:56] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Scott: Oh, Brett. Can you move back towards the camera ever so slightly? We want to  -- ooh, look at you, very spooky. Oh, look at both of you, very nice.<br /><br />[Laughter]<br /><br />Anyway, we wanted to take at least one photograph of that. So thank you very much. Yeah. It just took us a while to get the U stream to capture it properly. And you know what it was, it was a several second delay. So it’s sort of a little disorienting which is probably good.<br /><br />Brett: Yeah.<br /><br />Scott: But guys, I wanted to quickly, oh I just want to make sure I did … Adam and Jessica, I didn’t hear the name of the person you asked that question, but if, did that sort of address what you guys were asking?<br /><br />Adam: Yes. [1:41:54] [Inaudible]<br /><br />[Laughter]<br /><br />Scott: Awesome. Yeah. We’ve talked about building some crazy stuff here. IN fact, when Adam and Jessica were in Philadelphia on New Year’s, part of our plan was we were going to build some of the stuff. But then I think after talking more with Brett and Bonnie, it seemed that wasn’t really necessary and it probably was more important to really focus on the book of the month club and have that going. In any case, one thing –<br /><br />Brett: [1:42:25] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Bonnie:  [1:42:48] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Scott: Yeah. I was hoping you guys would be wearing them during this chat, but anyway, oh well.<br /><br />Brett: What’s that?<br /><br />Scott: I was hoping you’d be wearing them now during the video, but …<br /><br />Brett: [1:43:50] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Scott: I’ll share it with the rest of the group here. We’ll all try to fit in together.<br /><br />Brett:  [1:44:01] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Scott: One thing I just wanted to mention is it’s a little less than ten minutes before we usually end. One thing that – pretty much every single one of these weekly chats, there’s some interest to follow up with everyone. And I have to say, that’s probably on us but usually that rarely happens.<br /><br />One of the things we want to do – yeah it’s like there’s sort of these micro discussions that seem like there’s a real desire to continue. And they really don’t, partly because everyone’s busy but also partly because it’s probably not that easy. And we wanted to change that or at least make that a number of people ahd wanted to  change that. They’ve been asking us and have been pitching in to try and help make that happen.<br /><br />What I was mentioning right before the class question was that one of the things  the people from the public school wanted to help do during the year. Just like you guys are doing a year- long thing here  with the book of the month club, they wanted to offer the public school like the  Philly branch of the public school has a place to basically to follow up on interest that any of us have that we would like to  explore further. So basically, anything that has come up in the form of questions or interest that people might have that they just didn’t  ask per se.<br /><br />Or even something that you guys have said that anyone either in class there or in Skype or anyone else listening or anyone here would like to follow up on. We can form that into a very simple class proposal. Most of them probably won’t happen. But the ones that gain some interest can happen. So I just wanted to throw that out there and suggest that for this year we’ve turned on comments on the events on the basekamp site.<br /><br />We’ll be posting links to the audio just like we did for last week and also any links to public school courses that are created thru this process which set a number of them were last week probably because we were talking with them, but also I’m just thinking we may want to do that again. So that was a long winded way of saying, if you have ideas about those, feel free to type them in or post the comments and all, or say them now. I’ll send the link where you can post comments if that helps.<br /><br />Adam: Sure.<br /><br />Bonnie: [1:46:50] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Scott: Yeah.<br /><br />Bonnie: [1:46:55] [Inaudible] happened in Los Angeles?<br /><br />Scott: Yes.<br /><br />Bonnie: [1:47:02] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Scott: Basically the public school has branched into different locations. There’s one that has started in Chicago and one that started in Paris, Belgium and<br /><br />Brett: Brussels<br /><br />Scott: Oh, I’m sorry, did I say Belgium? In Brussels and in San Juan. Anyway, I won’t go on about it,  but I’ll paste the link so that you at least have a sense [Cross-talk]. Here’s the link to last week, the comments for last week which has links to the audio and we’ll be pasting links to the course. And then I’ll go ahead and also past the link  to this week’s. Just so that – oops. Yeah, paste the link to this week’s chat so you guys know where you can make recommendations for courses.<br /><br />Female 1: You talked about this AAAARG.org thing?<br /><br />Scott: Exactly. And in fact, the great thing about the way that’s set up now? Here’s where to post comments for this week. Sorry guys.<br /><br />Greg: We lost your stream.<br /><br />Scott: Anyway. Yeah, the AAAARG. Org is a place where like Bonnie and Brett like we had talked about posting the PDFs of their books from their library. And the great thing about creating a course is that we can tie any course to any publication on AAAARG very easily.<br /><br />They have a back end where the two sides are tied, so we can potentially carry on with a number of discussion threads or as course proposals that connect with any of the publications  in the Library of Radiant Optimism.<br /><br />Greg:  For instance I just proposed to class for the Philly Public School for making things out of buckets. So we could potentially use some of your texts – buckets.<br /><br />[Cross-talk]<br /><br />Yeah. Wouldn’t it be a great class?<br /><br />Scott: Yeah. Actually, we’ll send the link just so that you guys get a sense of what this is about and how approachable it is to suggest the course. It’s not something that you have to spend weeks or months putting together.<br /><br />They can develop into more full blown curriculum but they don’t have to. And some of the courses are extremely simple. Like one is called how to get in and out without being seen. And others are more developed of course.<br /><br />Brett: Sounds like a [1:49:57] [Inaudible] It’s awesome. Alright?<br /><br />Scott: So anyway, please add your comments to that length right above the last comment. Also, you should know that we’re eating fortune cookies that – What’s your name? Gerard Rock. And I think we should at least read you one fortune specifically for Bonnie, get it?<br /><br />[Cross-talk]<br /><br />Bonnie: Wait, I don’t get it.<br /><br />[Laughter]<br /><br />Greg: And mine says a good time to start something new.<br /><br />Bonnie: BY making buckets.<br /><br />Greg: Exactly.<br /><br />Scott: Well, yeah. Guys, thank you so much for joining us. I know we’ll carry on but being able to talk with you with everyone on audio has been a real pleasure.<br /><br />Brett: [1:51:09] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Bonnie: Yeah. This is really fun.<br /><br />Brett: So [1:51:16] [Inaudible] We also encourage you to [1:51:26] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Scott: Hey guys. We have some burning desires.<br /><br />Gerard: Late question. I arrived a little bit late. Make PDFs of everything. I kind of have been doing that for quite a few years. Do you  have  server you want to upload it to, or where do you, where you want it to go?<br /><br />Brett: [1:52:14] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Gerard: Scott and I can do that.  I mean, we have a pretty substantial library of stuff that’s pirated to share.<br /><br />Brett: Cool.<br /><br />Bonnie: Sorry. What’s your name? And do you have a place to access the server that you have set up or --?<br /><br />Gerard: No. I was asking if you knew of a good server to use. My name is Gerard.<br /><br />Bonnie: Oh.<br /><br />Scott: Yeah. I was just gonna recommend –<br /><br />Gerard: For wide access. Scott was recommending one right now. So …<br /><br />Scott: Yeah. In fact this site is tied to the  public school that were stating about. And the great thing about  proposing classes on the public school, I was suggesting that we do that in relations to this chat tonight, that you can also do things in relation to other things too. And you can tie  any of the PDFs that you upload to these courses. Great.<br /><br />Gerard. Thank you then.<br /><br />Scott: Awesome.<br /><br />Brett: [1:53:19] [Inaudible]<br /><br />Scott:  And we could definitely anybody who’s on. One other thing that might be kind of nice if anyone’s still listening. It looks like pretty much everyone is, we promise not to create a spam list but if you would like to send your emails to us, we can keep you in touch about this particular threat of conversation because there will be some ongoing updates. So many of you are already on our list, but the ones that aren’t, please let us know if you want to receive info. And we’ll do it. But anyway, that’s the least exciting of it. Thanks a lot, guys. It was great.<br /><br />Greg: Thanks, guys.<br /><br />Bonnie: Thank you. That was a lot of fun.<br /><br />[Applause]<br /><br />[Laughter]<br /><br />Scott: Stay warm everybody.<br /><br />[Background Noise]<br /><br />[1:54:37] End of Audio</p></div></div></div>  </div>
