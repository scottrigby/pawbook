<p>Hi Everyone,</p>
<p>This Tuesday is another event in a year-long series of weekly conversations and exhibits in 2010 shedding light on examples of Plausible Artworlds.</p>
<p>This week we’ll be talking with Florian Schneider, one of the founders and administrators of <span class="caps"><span class="caps">KEIN</span></span>.<span class="caps"><span class="caps">ORG</span></span>, a collaborative networking environment that offers a wide range of internet services to activists and artists, groups and individuals from around the globe.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.kein.org/" title="http://www.kein.org/">http://www.kein.org/</a></p>
<p><span class="caps"><span class="caps">KEIN</span></span>.<span class="caps"><span class="caps">ORG</span></span> started in 1997 at Documenta X with the launch of the “no one is illegal” campaign. The group soon set up its own server and developed its own networking infrastructure. The idea of <span class="caps"><span class="caps">KEIN</span></span>.<span class="caps"><span class="caps">ORG</span></span> is self-supply in terms of networking techniques, operating on a strictly self-authorized and self-organized basis. <span class="caps"><span class="caps">KEIN</span></span>.<span class="caps"><span class="caps">ORG</span></span> runs eleven servers situated at various locations in Europe and beyond, hosting more than 500 websites, some 200 content management systems and countless mailing lists and email-accounts. A plausible world of plausible worlds, one might venture to say — except that the people at <span class="caps"><span class="caps">KEIN</span></span>.<span class="caps"><span class="caps">ORG</span></span> would likely point out that this is “<span class="caps"><span class="caps">KEIN</span></span> world” — “kein” being the negative indefinite article in German that negates whatever noun follows it (translating as “no” or “none”): the <span class="caps"><span class="caps">KEIN</span></span>.<span class="caps"><span class="caps">ORG</span></span> website abounds in straight-faced play on the word that they are, featuring “<span class="caps"><span class="caps">KEIN</span></span> manifesto”, “<span class="caps"><span class="caps">KEIN</span></span> history”, “<span class="caps">KEIN</span> community — <span class="caps"><span class="caps">KEIN</span></span>.<span class="caps"><span class="caps">ORG</span></span> eluding identity by stating it is not what it is. But the word play makes a serious point, as their manifesto points out. It’s short and very much to the point:</p>
<p>“<span class="caps"><span class="caps">KEIN</span></span>.<span class="caps"><span class="caps">ORG</span></span> implies no organization: No organs, no shared purpose, no common ground, no identity and no feedback.</p>
<p>But rather than a negation <span class="caps"><span class="caps">KEIN</span></span> marks the moment of withdrawal, an escape, an indefinite line of flight out of the overcoded structures of networks as formed-matter, of networked economies, of a standardized and controlled production of networked subjectivity.</p>
<p><span class="caps"><span class="caps">KEIN</span></span> is a machine for the production of production. It is asignificant as such: it produces not meaning, but means. But it has itself no means: it is free, free of charges, free of advertisement, free of liability, free of claims, free of complaints, free of duties, free of representation.</p>
<p><span class="caps"><span class="caps">KEIN</span></span>.<span class="caps"><span class="caps">ORG</span></span> is about self-authorization, un-organizing and becoming fluid. There is no staff and there are no assets. But there are lots of links, connections, and conjunctions to be made.”</p>
