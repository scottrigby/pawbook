# About the book

Hello and welcome!

This website is here to help us all compile and co-edit a collaborative publication from research, conversations and projects connecting with the wider Plausible Artworlds initiative.

We've begun by transcribing all of the weekly chats from 2010, and added as individual book pages on this site. We've also included the "backchannel" written conversation that simultaneously happened as part of the audio discussions. Those of you who joined us know each week was different - some had more audio or written conversation (sometimes all of one and none of the other). The recorded conversations are also available and linked within each book page - though the audio is extraordinarily rough.

## Contents?

Click through the book navigation on the right side of the screenâ€¦ there's also a pager at the bottom of each book page.

## Context?

If you're coming to this project for the first time, we've included an introduction to the wider Plausible Artworlds project at the beginning of the book, weekly examples of what we insist on calling "plausible artworlds", and a more elaborate FAQ at the end.

## Format?

For a note on the format of this book (if you're wondering why the pages look broken and/or ridiculously awesome) see How to read this book.

## Contribute?

If you're a contributor and want to help edit your book page, make sure to login (if you haven't registered, please do and let us know when you have so we can prioritize your edits).

If you're looking for ways to get involved - whether you're dropping by for the first time or coming back for more - feel free to comment on the book pages, as extended follow-up conversations for each weekly example. If you'd like to volunteer to help with the publication please ask - there are still things people can do.
